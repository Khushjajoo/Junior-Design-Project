# Bidirectional People Counter & Room Monitoring System
This project is a real-time, embedded room monitoring system built using Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensors, and an OLED display, designed to track and manage room occupancy. It uses two ultrasonic sensors to detect the direction of movement (entry or exit), updating a people count accordingly. The current occupancy is shown on a 7-segment display, while a connected OLED screen provides human-readable messages like “Room is empty” or “Room is full” based on predefined thresholds. The system uses I2C communication for the OLED and UART to send serial data such as distance and count, making it easy to integrate with broader monitoring or automation systems. Designed with safety and efficiency in mind, it demonstrates how embedded sensing can enhance real-world access control and crowd management.
