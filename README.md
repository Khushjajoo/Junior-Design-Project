In recent years, we have seen how a healthy lifestyle is so important for us to survive. A healthy lifestyle is not only beneficial to us but also people around us and the people who we are in near contact with. Our electronic access control system manages access to a room based on the occupancy of the room for healthy individuals. By guaranteeing that the space is not overcrowded, the system permits healthy people to enter. An easy access machine created using Arduino and sensors, opens door lock for people entering and exiting the room, and keeps a count of people inside the room and displays the number of people and the capacity of the room. It also provides indicators for how crowded the room is.
