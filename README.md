# Bidirectional People Counter & Room Monitoring System (the C code)
This project is a real-time, embedded room monitoring system built using Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensors, and an OLED display, designed to track and manage room occupancy. It uses two ultrasonic sensors to detect the direction of movement (entry or exit), updating a people count accordingly. The current occupancy is shown on a 7-segment display, while a connected OLED screen provides human-readable messages like “Room is empty” or “Room is full” based on predefined thresholds. The system uses I2C communication for the OLED and UART to send serial data such as distance and count, making it easy to integrate with broader monitoring or automation systems. Designed with safety and efficiency in mind, it demonstrates how embedded sensing can enhance real-world access control and crowd management.


# Bidirectional People Counter & Room Monitoring System (the Arduino code)
This project is a real-time room monitoring system built using Arduino Uno, combining bidirectional people counting, temperature sensing, and visual feedback for smarter occupancy management. It uses two ultrasonic sensors to detect entries and exits, updating a counter displayed on a 7-segment display. Based on occupancy, LEDs indicate current room load (green for low, yellow for medium, red for full). A temperature sensor continuously monitors ambient conditions, with visual alerts triggered for high temperatures. The system uses I2C for OLED display, SevSeg for numeric output, and UART for serial communication, offering a simple yet effective embedded solution for safe and efficient indoor space management.
